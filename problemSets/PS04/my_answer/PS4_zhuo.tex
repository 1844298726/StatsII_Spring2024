\section*{Question 1}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent We're interested in modeling the historical causes of child mortality. We have data from 26855 children born in Skellefte√•, Sweden from 1850 to 1884. Using the "child" dataset in the \texttt{eha} library, fit a Cox Proportional Hazard model using mother's age and infant's gender as covariates. Present and interpret the output.

\textbf{Result}:\\
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Q1.png}\\
The coefficient of m.age is 0.007617, which means that for every one year increase in maternal age, the risk of child death increases by approximately 0.76\%.\\
The coefficient of sexfemale is -0.082215, which means that female infants have a lower risk of death compared to male infants, and the risk of death for female infants is about 7.89\% lower than that for male infants.\\
In statistics, the coefficients of both maternal age and infant gender variables are significant (p.value \textless 0.05), indicating that their impact on predicting child mortality is significant.\\
The Concordance statistic is 0.519, indicating the consistency of the model.
The p-values of the log likelihood ratio test, Wald test, and score logrank test are all very small (p-value = 0.00001), indicating a good overall fit of the model.
